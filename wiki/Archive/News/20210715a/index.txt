The gzip package will be removed 22/07/2021 and replaced with pigz. This is not
a swap in gzip implementations as our gzip has been pigz in disguise for some
time now. This is just a package rename.

Some manual intervention is required. Run the following to transition before
the date listed above.

    kiss u
    kiss b pigz
    kiss i pigz
    kiss a | grep ^pigz | kiss a -
    kiss r gzip
