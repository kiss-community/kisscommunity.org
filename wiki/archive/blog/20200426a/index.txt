Subject	This month in KISS (#1)
From	Dylan Araps &lt;dylan@k1ss.org&gt;
Date	Tue, 25 Apr 2020 12:07:09 +0100

Hello,

First off. Apologies for the rather large delay in the release of this post. My
laptop of four years decided to never again turn on. The model (Lenovo Yoga 900)
is plagued with power issues which I came to know very well.

This caused me to take a temporary leave from my usual post until a replacement
laptop could arrive. I was gone a total of 18 days, I believe. I would like to
thank the community and all users for keeping things going while I was gone.

I was able to replace the laptop in a timely manner due to three very generous
donations which I received out of the blue. I can't even begin to thank you,
your kindness left me over the moon.

From now on, these posts will be written and published monthly (instead of
weekly). This will make the posts fuller, more interesting and allow me to
spend more time writing them.

Seeing as I was inactive for a good part of this month, this post will be
smaller than what I envisioned for "This Month in KISS". Expect the next one
to be what I describe above.

KISS saw a large influx of users while I was away and I'd like to formally
welcome everyone. o/

(KISS has also recently been added to DistroWatch!

NEW LAPTOP

I now develop KISS on an "Honor MagicBook 14". For those unaware of "Honor",
it's a company owned by Huawei (which previously stuck to the release of various
Android smartphones but has since released laptops).

The laptop was â‚¬550 and arrived within a week of purchase. This being Greece,
I was able to buy the laptop online with cash (via cash-on-delivery)! It's a
cool system which enables you to shop online without the use of a card/Paypal.

I'm very happy with the laptop. I didn't have much choice in the matter as my
priorities were obtaining something quickly and within my budget (at that time).
I believe I made the best choice possible in that moment.

The specification are as follows:

- Ryzen 3500u (I now have 4 cores instead of the 2 I had prior!)
- 256GB NVME SSD (It's weird not having /dev/sdXY anymore)
- 8GB of memory (7GB usable) (The aGPU actually reserves 1GB for its own use)
- 1080p IPS matte display (Very nice for outdoor usage)

Odd/Interesting things:

- The webcam sits *below* a key on the keyboard and a press will pop it up.
  There's no webcam in the usual place (above the display). I no longer have to
  tape up my webcam in other words.

- The FN key is more like Caps Lock than Shift (a toggle). I don't know if this
  is something uncommon but I've never personally come across it.

- The power button is a fingerprint reader. While I'm no longer taping my
  webcam, I'm now taping over my power button.

- The laptop charges (with fast charging) over USB-C. I'm really happy with this
  as my last laptop had its own special charger and replacements were nigh
  impossible to find.


PACKAGE MANAGER CHANGES

A lot of smaller changes have been made and a myriad of bugs fixed. I'll stick
to mentioning the interesting or major changes as this post will be rather long.

The package manager no longer uses 'rsync' to handle transfers during
installation and instead handles everything using basic utilities (cp, etc).
In other words; if you do not personally use rsync, you may now remove it!

The behavior of 'kiss &lt;action>' when no further arguments are passed has
changed. Instead of aborting, the package manager will check to see if '$PWD'
resolves to a kiss package.

What I've been told is CRUX-like usage looks as follows (zlib as example):

-> cd /path/to/zlib
-> kiss b
-> kiss i

What's great about this is that it bypasses your enabled list of repositories.
The repository it belongs to will be added to your `$KISS_PATH` _only_ for this
invocation of the package manager.

Any utilities named in 'kiss-*' in your '$PATH' will now integrate directly
with the package manager. They'll appear in the help output and be usable via
'kiss &lt;name>' (&lt;name> being the utlitity name with 'kiss-' stripped).

Here's what it looks like:

    -> kiss [a|b|c|i|l|r|s|u|v] [pkg] [pkg] [pkg]
    -> alternatives List and swap to alternatives
    -> build        Build a package
    -> checksum     Generate checksums
    -> install      Install a package
    -> list         List installed packages
    -> remove       Remove a package
    -> search       Search for a package
    -> update       Check for updates
    -> version      Package manager version

    -> Installed extensions (kiss-* in $PATH)
    -> cargo-urlgen   Generate sources for rust packages.
    -> chbuild        Create/destroy temporary chroots.
    -> chroot         Enter a kiss chroot.
    -> depends        Display a package's dependencies.
    -> depends-finder Find missing dependencies by parsing 'ldd'.
    -> export         Turn an installed package into a KISS tarball.
    -> fork           Fork a package to the current directory.
    -> link           Link a repository file to another repository.
    -> maintainer     Find the maintainer of a package.
    -> manifest       Display all files owned by a package.
    -> manifest-tree  Display all files owned by a package in a tree.
    -> new            Create a boilerplate package.
    -> orphans        List orphaned packages.
    -> outdated       Check installed packages for updates.
    -> owns           Check which package owns a file.
    -> repodepends    Display a package's original dependencies.
    -> reset          Remove all packages except for the base.
    -> revdepends     Display packages which depend on package.
    -> size           Show the size on disk for a package.



FLATPAK

One of the most frequent questions I receive about KISS is support for software
like Steam, Spotify, Discord and others which don't run natively on musl at all.

There are also open source offerings like Libreoffice, Gimp, Krita, etc which
are very difficult and time consuming to package (especially given KISS' chosen
software stack)..

I usually answer this question by directing users to a 'glibc chroot'. What this
entails is a chroot of a glibc distribution which is then used to house and run
the software.

This runs flawlessly though is a little difficult to setup and manage compared
Flatpaks, snaps and appimages.

I have packaged Flatpak for KISS and modified it to fit nicely into the system.
For now, Flatpak lives in a separate repository as there is a rather important
bug which needs to be resolved.

KISS doesn't lock you into a single provider for Audio and an ALSA only system
is typically what users go for. An issue with Flatpak arises where any Flatpaks
without support for ALSA will refuse to output sound.

Using something like apulse to solve the issue isn't possible as apulse would
have to live _inside_ the Flatpak (and not on the host). Flatpak also expects
a functional PulseAudio server to be running on the host.

Most Flatpaks will still function correctly without working audio. What's funny
is that one of the Flatpaks which crashes on startup (due to no audio) is
LibreOffice(!).

I'm exploring a number of solutions to this problem and I hope to have some kind
of working fix soon. If anyone knows more or has tried to solve this problem
themselves, please get in touch.

KISS PORTED TO i586

KISS has been ported to i586 by a user. The author of the port can explain
things better than I:

> I found this machine and would have probably thrown it away, but I decided
> to wrap my head around porting KISS to another architecture and show this old
>  metal some love.

> Xserver, ffmpeg + mpv and webkit2gtk are running. Webkit2gtk takes more than
> overnight to compile :D . Gcc takes ~6h.

> I have released a chroot in my repo. Its still WIP!

USER REPOSITORY FOR DBUS and friends.

A user by the name of Perish has created a KISS repository which provides dbus
and any related software with the goal to also provide Bluez for working
Bluetooth support.

Any KISS user can simply clone this repository, add it to their `KISS_PATH` and
install dbus (eventually Bluez too).

USER REPOSITORY for OPENJDK and friends

Another user repository (with a specific purpose) has popped up. This time by
a user named Eudaldgr and with the aim to provide working versions of openjdk.

OpenJDK still requires some work before it can be built and the repository is
looking for contributors to assist in this method. If you're interested,
check it out.
