Hello everyone!

Today marks one year since the first commit to the KISS repositories.
In other words, KISS turned 1 today! I'll write more about this in my
monthly post in the coming two to three weeks.

I'd like to thank everyone for their continued support. I hope you're
all getting as much out of KISS as I am. Onwards to two years!
