Subject	This month in KISS (#3)!

Welcome to the third monthly update for KISS Linux. The focus this month was on
documentation and the reopening of the distribution's Wiki. A big thank you to
those filling the Wiki with words.

The first thing you may notice is the website's new overall look. The new Wiki
demanded features be added to the static site generator and the website also
reaped these rewards.

[1.0] A new logo appears!
________________________________________________________________________________

KISS now has a "real" logo. The idea came to me as I was writing new pages for
the website. I'm very pleased with how it turned out. It can be displayed as an
image (TBA) or simply as ASCII text (as seen below).

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |
|                                                                              |

|                                                                              |

This text based representation of the logo also enables its usage in terminals,
plain-text email and well... anywhere that text is available.


[2.0] Website changes
________________________________________________________________________________

Every page on the website now uses a uniform line length (80 characters) which
is far wider than the myriad of lengths used prior. The static website generator
now supports hyperlinks via a minimal syntax as well as linking between two
elements.

This linking allows for easy implementation of references as well as a table of
contents where needed. Best of all is that these are all simple 'sed' calls
during generation time. [0]

Every page on the website has been rewritten to fit the aforementioned changes
and the reading experience should now be far more enjoyable. For those wondering
what the old website used to look like, see [1].

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

I decided to close the old Wiki as it was difficult to work with, unstructured
and all over the place. This turned contributors away and its information began
to rot over time. [2]

These issues have been solved in the rebirth and contributions have been steady
since its opening. I hope to see this become a bountiful resource for users of
KISS and beyond.

Once again, a big thank you to everyone writing pages.

[4.0] kiss help
________________________________________________________________________________

The distribution's documentation is now browsable via a tiny utility included
with the package manager. The installation guide, FAQ, Wiki(!) and all other
documentation is also available by default.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Usage of the above utility is as follows.

|  ...                                                                         |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This will open the desired page in the pager of your choosing ('less' by
default). This is configurable via the $PAGER environment variable. One can of
course browse the txt files in /usr/share/doc/kiss directly, this merely adds a
little sugar on top.

For those wondering about disk space requirements, all documentation (including
the entire Wiki) come in at around 400K~ (for 50 pages of information).


[5.0] Package manager changes
________________________________________________________________________________

The package manager saw a few nice improvements and a range of bug fixes.

* Added two new hooks ('post-package' and 'pre-extract'). The latter is nice as
  it enables the package manager's cache to live entirely in memory.
  See #/package-manager#6.0 and #/package-manager#6.3

* Handling of Git sources has been revamped with clones of all types now done in
  a shallow manner (where supported). This includes default branch clones,
  branch clones as well as clones of specific Git commits.

* Package installation and removal have been simplified, code is now shared
  between the two and /less/ is done overall. This comes with a nice performance
  increase as less external utilities are used per-file.

* Added a new action called 'download' (also aliased to 'd') which downloads
  all sources for a package (or list of packages). This allows one to
  pre-download all sources for non-networked builds later.


[6.0] Package manager in C?
________________________________________________________________________________

I have started work on an alternative implementation of the package manager
written in C (C99). This is where the majority of my time has been spent for the
past 12 days (Git stats: 269 commits,  22,954 ++  21,029 --).

Things are coming along nicely with package listing, package searching,
source downloads, checksum verification/generation and package builds in
working order.

The goal is a single, statically linked executable with little to no reliance
on overall system health. In other words, a broken system shouldn't also break
the package manager.

This implementation will eventually become the default package manager with the
current shell based one offered as an alternative. If all goes well, the new
package manager should be ready for early testing in a month or so.

[7.0] The build machine has arrived
________________________________________________________________________________

The build machine donated by a very generous KISS user finally arrived this week
after a long stay at customs and countless phone calls back and forth.

It is a beautifully made machine and it runs silently at full load. The system
even came with KISS installed! A thank you from the bottom of my heart for the
donation. I will never forget this.

I finished setting it up just yesterday and it will be put to use as a build
machine (as mentioned in last month's post @/20200525a). It will additionally be
used as a test bed to explore the large number of ideas in my TODO list.


[8.0] KDE comes to KISS
________________________________________________________________________________

Dilyn Corner has successfully ported KDE to KISS! I mentioned this last month
though it only recently reached a usable state. This is wonderful to see!

[9.0] LXQT comes to KISS

This is still in its early stages though Eudald Gubert i Roldan has begun the
work in porting LXQT to KISS.

James Davies has ported KISS to ARMV7! James is also the creator of the AARCH64
and PPC64LE ports.
