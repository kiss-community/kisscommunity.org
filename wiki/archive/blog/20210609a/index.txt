Subject 09/06/2021: This month in KISS (#9)!
From    Dilyn Corner
Date    Wed, 09 Jun 2021 19:21:00 -0500

Welcome to month 9!

Our dreams of no longer having to patch firefox to remove gtk+2 were dashed ever
so slightly -- the build system still checks for gtk+2. For now, the patch
stays. Albeit, more slimmed down. One day, perhaps, firefox will enter 2011.

A bug in how kiss handles dependencies has emerged. While not breaking (or even
terribly awful), it's still a bug! Checkout the issue for more:
$/kiss-community/kiss/issues/29

Speaking of dependencies, it was recently asked on IRC which dependencies are
implicit and which should always be mentioned in the depends file. There isn't
currently something penned down on this, so I figured I'd write something here
that can later be documented formally.

Things that can be implicit and left out of the depends file are:
- git
- binutils
- gcc
- make
- musl
- busybox

Basically, you can assume a functioning toolchain and the basic tools supplied
by busybox. git is implicit because... Well... It's a large part of kiss.

Outside of this short list, dependencies should always be specified.


Finally, there was some recent movement on Dylan's GitHub page. $/dylanaraps
I've said it many times but I'll say it again: if he makes his way back and
wants the reigns, he's more than welcome to the domain and VPS.


And here are all of the changes since the last post! Have a great month.
