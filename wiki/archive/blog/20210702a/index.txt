Subject 02/07/2021: This month in KISS (#10)!
From    Dilyn Corner
Date    Fri, 02 Jul 2021 09:15:00 -0500

Welcome to month 10!

After a long hiatus, filled presumably with an abundance of self-care and
recentering, Dylan Araps is back lads! Some interesting things have emerged as a
result -- k1sslinux.xyz (and kisslinux.org has been parked...), a flurry of
updates to the $/kisslinux website and repo repositories, and kiss has seen a
litany of pull requests, from small tweaks and fixes, to large-scale bug
squashing!

Dilyn Corner (2):
      kiss: fix some extra spaces
      kiss: bump version

Dylan Araps (8):
      kiss: Fix incorrect check during updates
      kiss: do a less shallow clone to enable 'git describe'
      pkg_install_files: fix internal path issue.
      kiss-chroot: Mount /dev/shm, /dev/pts, /tmp and /run
      pkg_checksums: simplify
      kiss: remove broken directory symlinks
      kiss: fix bugs with pkg_build
      kiss: sanitize tmp directory paths

Only time may tell what will happen in the future! I'll provide updates whenever
I have them. In the meantime, work at $/kiss-community will continue as normal -
I won't be offended if you change your remotes :)


As I said earlier, some very large PRs have made their way onto the
$/kiss-community/kiss repository. They're quite big, so having some extra people
helping to break them would be wonderful! They'll slowly filter in over the next
week.

Until next time!
    Dilyn
