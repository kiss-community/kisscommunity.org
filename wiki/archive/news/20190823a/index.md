# 23/08/2019: KISS repository split

The `public` repository was split from the main repositories and renamed
to `community`. This change was made to reflect the split in maintainer
responsibility. This repository is now disabled by default.

It goes to say that the KISS developers are not solely responsible for
maintaining packages in this repository. By enabling this repository you
accept the risks of a curated community repository.

To enable `community` follow the instructions here:
