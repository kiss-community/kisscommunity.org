# 14/01/2020: Firefox binaries now available

Binaries for Firefox are now available in the official repositories
under the package name `firefox-bin`.

This allows you to remove Rust, cbindgen, GTK+2, Python 2, nodejs, Clang
and never have to build or install them again.

Those who would still rather build their own Firefox are able to do so
by installing the `firefox` package.

KISS also now tracks the Extended Release versions of Firefox which
update less often providing less of a burden each update.
