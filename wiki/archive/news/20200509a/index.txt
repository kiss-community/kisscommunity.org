Subject	GCC 10.1.0 kernel issue

The kernel compiled with GCC 10.1.0 may crash on boot. This doesn't
seem to affect every system. I have thus far received a single report
by an affected user.

Attached below is a patch which has been reported to fix the issue.
This fix has not yet made it into a kernel release (let alone Linus'
tree).

I recommend applying the patch if compiling a kernel with GCC 10.1.0.
An additional note will be added to the installation guide for the
benefit of new users.

UPDATE (May 19 2020):

Kernel versions 5.6.14 (latest stable) and 5.4.42 (latest LTS)
contain fixes for GCC 10 and no patch is needed.


UPDATE:

Another alternative is to simply disable the stack protector in your
kernel configuration. This will also fix the kernel crashing during
the boot up process.

    CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR=n
    CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG=n

Notes:

- Reported to apply cleanly to kernel version 5.6.11.
- Hop on IRC, Reddit or send me an email (dylan@k1ss.org) if you
