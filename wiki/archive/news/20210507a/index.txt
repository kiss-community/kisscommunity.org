Subject Kernel 5.12.0 build issue

The launch of the 5.12.0 kernel resulted in a potential problem!  It's unclear
how many people this impacts; there have only been a few reports in IRC,
including me. There is a missing #include statement in one file.

A simple:
    sed -i '/&ltstdlib.h&gt/a #include &ltlinux/stddef.h&gt' \
        tools/objtool/arch/x86/decode.c

Should resolve the issue!

This persists through at least 5.12.2, and there are no obvious changes in
Linus' tree to indicate it's been reported or fixed.
