Hello,

KISS is moving to openssl and wayland. This is two breaking changes being made
at the same time. The transition will not be automated in any way. Things will
be volatile for a short period before settling down again.

This change will take place in three days (11/07/2021) at 15:00:00 UTC.

See:

    - $/kisslinux/repo/pull/269
    - $/kisslinux/repo/pull/266
    - $/kisslinux/repo/issues/270
    - $/kisslinux/repo/issues/263

A blog post will be made shortly to announce the new changes to the
repositories, the package manager and the distribution. Stay tuned. :)

    Dylan
