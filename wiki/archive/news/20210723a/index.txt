The KISS Linux website is now at https://kisslinux.org thanks to the generosity
of the domain's previous owner. I received an email yesterday with an offer to
donate the domain to the project of which I gracefully accepted.

The .xyz domain will no longer be used. A 301 redirect has been setup to send
traffic to the new domain. The email on the .xyz domain will remain active for
a short while.

I want to publicly thank this individual and their act of kindness.
KISS Linux now has a new home.
