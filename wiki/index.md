# KISS Linux Community

KISS Linux is a meta-distribution created by Dylan Araps, featuring the `kiss` package manager which makes it easy to maintain your own system.

> [KISS Linux](https://web.archive.org/web/20240224161022/https://kisslinux.org/) is an independent Linux(R) distribution with a focus on simplicity and the concept of less is more.

We're on IRC at #kisslinux on [libera.chat](irc://irc.libera.chat) ([logs are available here](https://libera.irclog.whitequark.org/kisslinux)).
