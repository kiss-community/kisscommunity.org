# KISS Linux Community

KISS Linux is a meta-distribution created by Dylan Araps, featuring the `kiss` package manager which makes it easy to maintain your own system.

> [KISS Linux](https://kisslinux.github.io/) is an independent Linux(R) distribution with a focus on simplicity and the concept of less is more.

We're on IRC at #kisslinux on [libera.chat](irc://irc.libera.chat) ([logs are available here](https://libera.irclog.whitequark.org/kisslinux)).

## Important links
**WARNING**: the old `kisslinux.org` website seems to have been taken over by bad actors and although it looks similar to Dylan's pages (which have expired) they contain analytics and adverts. Dylan's website is now available here: <https://kisslinux.github.io/>
