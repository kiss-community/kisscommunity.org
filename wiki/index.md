# KISS Linux Community

KISS Linux is a meta-distribution created by Dylan Araps, featuring the `kiss` package manager which makes it easy to maintain your own system.

> [KISS Linux](https://kisslinux.github.io/) is an independent Linux(R) distribution with a focus on simplicity and the concept of less is more.

KISS uses a concise plain-text package system which is parsed by the small, portable, and self-contained [package manager](kiss/package-manager/) written in POSIX shell.
By default, KISS is based on musl libc and busybox, but there's no lock-in to specific software; everything can be replaced.
The [main repository](https://codeberg.org/kiss-community/repo) is a small and opinionated base of packages which users can build upon to suit their needs.

We're on IRC at #kisslinux on [libera.chat](irc://irc.libera.chat) ([logs are available here](https://libera.irclog.whitequark.org/kisslinux)).
