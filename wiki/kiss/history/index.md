# A Brief History of KISS Linux

You might wonder why there is such a separation between official KISS and the KISS Community.

- May 2019: Dylan Araps creates puke, a "new package manager experiment"
- Jun 2019: puke is renamed kiss
- ...
- Nov 2020: Dylan disappears
- Feb 2021: Dilyn Corner is elected as the leader of the community
- Jun-Jul 2021: Dylan reappears, Dilyn steps back
- Dec 2021: Dylan disappears
- Apr 2024: Dylan took up farming.

Now the community is run by a small group.
